## The App
This is a simple project populating a collection view with data from an api.
Selecting a cell will present a detail view with a larger UIImageView and title.

## App Architecture
Since the project was so simple, I decided to use the MVC architecture with programmatic views.

## CocoaPods
Utilized the Kingfisher cocoapod to set the UIImageView images.

## Testing
Added unit tests for the model, APIClient, and view controllers


## Future Iterations
For future implementations, I think it would be an interesting idea to translate the latin titles provided by the api to the device's set language.
